# Creator Profile Teardown

Turn a social profile into a sourced, repeatable content playbook, using the Eden MCP tools available in this environment.

## Inputs

- Profile URL or handle and platform.
- Brand, audience, market, and the decision the teardown should inform.
- Optional time window, sample size, Brand Core, and comparison account.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the official account with `eden_resolve_creator` or `eden_search_creators`, then use `eden_analyze_creator` to pull profile metadata, public links, and a representative recent-post sample.
2. Use `eden_analyze_list` / `eden_search_social_content` and `eden_get_analytics` to compare posts against the account's own baseline. Use `eden_study_top_carousels` for carousel-format accounts specifically. Separate repeatable outliers from giveaways, collaborations, paid distribution, and isolated viral events.
3. Use `eden_read_social_post` on the standout posts for full text/transcript, and `eden_search_highlights` where audience response (comments, reactions) affects the conclusion.
4. Identify the account's audience promise, positioning, personality, content pillars, recurring series, formats, hooks, proof, calls to action, visual patterns, and cadence.
5. Separate observed mechanics from inferred explanations. Explain several plausible drivers when causality is uncertain.
6. Translate the strongest patterns into brand-specific tests. Adapt the mechanism and audience insight, not the creator's wording or identity.

## Output

- Positioning, promise, audience, voice, and profile-funnel summary.
- Content-pillar and recurring-series table with sourced examples.
- Ranked outlier posts with normalized lift and possible drivers.
- Hook, format, proof, CTA, cadence, and audience-response patterns.
- What to adapt, what not to copy, and five prioritized tests for the user's brand.
- Coverage, source appendix, confidence, and limitations.

## Guardrails

- Do not reduce the teardown to a profile summary; identify repeatable mechanics.
- Do not copy distinctive wording, private details, likeness, or personal identity.
- Do not claim that a pattern caused performance when the evidence only shows correlation.
- Preserve source links and clearly label inference.
- If Eden's index has no data for the requested account/platform, say so explicitly rather than fabricating post history or performance numbers.
